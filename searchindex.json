But, that\u0026rsquo;s not the case here, and to understand it in a better way we can break the term and try to understand it in a better way.\n\u0026ldquo;Consumer\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Right\u0026rdquo; can be first understood differently as;\n\u0026ldquo;Right\u0026rdquo; can simply be defined as a special permission or entitlement to do something.\n\u0026ldquo;Consumer\u0026rdquo; can although be defined as under Section 2(7) of Consumer Protection Act, 2019 yet to understand it in a better way and so that a layman can understand it as well, we can say that a consumer is any person who gives money or some sort of consideration in exchange of getting some product or services either it be governmental or even private.\nThe very closest example to every one\u0026rsquo;s daily life can be given as when a person goes to buy a product at some store and eventually buys it, he automatically becomes a consumer as he bought the services provided by a company in either product form or in some actual services.\nThe definition as per law is reiterated herein below as,\nSection 2(7):Â \u0026quot;consumer\u0026quot; means any person who ---\n(i) buys any goods for a consideration which has been paid or promised or partly paid and partly promised, or under any system of deferred payment and includes any user of such goods other than the person who buys such goods for consideration paid or promised or partly paid or partly promised, or under any system of deferred payment, when such use is made with the approval of such person, but does not include a person who obtains such goods for resale or for any commercial purpose; or\n(ii) hires or avails of any service for a consideration which has been paid or promised or partly paid and partly promised, or under any system of deferred payment and includes any beneficiary of such service other than the person who hires or avails of the services for consideration paid or promised, or partly paid and partly promised, or under any system of deferred payment, when such services are availed of with the approval of the first mentioned person, but does not include a person who avails of such service for any commercial purpose.\nExplanation. --For the purposes of this clause, --\n(a) the expression \u0026quot;commercial purpose\u0026quot; does not include use by a person of goods bought and used by him exclusively for the purpose of earning his livelihood, by means of self-employment;\n(b) the expressions \u0026quot;buys any goods\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;hires or avails any services\u0026quot; includes offline or online transactions through electronic means or by teleshopping or direct selling or multi-level marketing;\nEvery consumer as defined under law has a set of \u0026ldquo;Rights\u0026rdquo; per say, just like every citizen of this country has Fundamental Rights, known as \u0026ldquo;Consumer Rights\u0026rdquo;.\nThe main question arises here is, even if we say that a consumer has a set of rights, where would a person/consumer go to get those rights enforced?\nThe Indian Legislation came out with its solution way back in 1986 with introducing Consumer Protection Act, 1986, which introduced the concept of Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum\u0026rsquo;s (CDRF) or some other forums such as NCDRC and etc.\nIt is by far the easiest to approach a CDRF or NCDRC in such consumer related matters where and get the dispute resolved, even sometimes amicably.\nThe whole idea behind introduction of such initiative was solely based on challenging the monopoly of big stake holders who with the help of their economic wealth dominated market and exploited the consumers.\nNow when we look at the present situation, it is very difficult for such stake holders dominate the consumers and exploit them, and it is all because of introduction of Consumer Rights.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/blog/understanding_consumer_rights_in_india/","title":"Understanding Consumer Rights in India","description":"Imagine this scenario, you save up your pocket money to buy a brand new smartphone.

After just a week of use, the screen stops working. When you go back to the shop, the seller refuses to replace it. What do you do? This is exactly why consumer rights exist in India. The Consumer Protection Act, 2019 is like your legal shield that protects you from such unfair situations. Let\u0026rsquo;s explore this important topic in detail so you can become a smart and informed consumer.\nWho Exactly Qualifies as a Consumer? In simple terms, a consumer is any individual who purchases goods or services for personal use. This definition covers almost everything you buy, from school supplies and snacks to electronic gadgets and movie tickets. Even when your parents pay for your school fees or medical treatment, they are acting as consumers. The law recognises that consumers often have less power compared to big businesses, which is why special protections have been created to ensure fair treatment for all buyers.\nThe Six Fundamental Consumer Rights everybody should know The Consumer Protection Act guarantees every Indian consumer six crucial rights that form the foundation of fair trade practices. The first and perhaps most important is your right to safety. This means any product you purchase should not pose any danger to your life or property. Manufacturers are legally required to ensure their products meet strict safety standards before they reach consumers like you.\nYour second right is to have complete and accurate information. When you\u0026rsquo;re deciding what to buy, the seller must provide all relevant details about the product. This includes its price, ingredients or components, manufacturing date, expiry date, and proper usage instructions. Companies cannot hide negative aspects of their products or make false claims in advertisements.\nThe third right protects your freedom of choice. In a healthy market, consumers should have access to a variety and competition. No seller can force you to purchase a particular brand or limit your options artificially. This right becomes especially important when dealing with monopolies or essential services where choices might be limited.\nFourth comes your right to be heard and have your complaints addressed. If you have a genuine grievance about a product or service, the concerned business must provide a proper channel to register your complaint and take appropriate action. Many companies now have dedicated customer care departments for this very purpose.\nThe fifth right ensures you can seek compensation when things go wrong. Known as the right to redressal, this allows consumers to approach consumer courts for replacement, refund, or monetary compensation in case of defective products or deficient services. The legal system provides special fast-track courts specifically for consumer disputes.\nFinally, you have the right to consumer education. This means the government, schools, and consumer organisations should work together to make sure every citizen, including students like you, understands their rights and responsibilities as consumers. After all, knowledge is the best protection against exploitation.\nHow the 2019 Law Improved Consumer Protection The updated Consumer Protection Act introduced several significant changes to keep pace with modern shopping trends. One major advancement was including e-commerce transactions under consumer protection. Now, if you face issues with online purchases, whether it\u0026rsquo;s late delivery, wrong items, or counterfeit products, you have the same rights as in physical stores.\nAnother important change is the concept of product liability. Manufacturers can now be held directly responsible if their defective products cause harm to consumers. This has made companies more careful about quality control and safety testing. The law also introduced provisions for class action lawsuits, allowing groups of consumers to file joint complaints against unfair practices.\nTo make justice more accessible, the new law simplified the complaint filing process. Consumers can now register complaints online from anywhere in the country. The introduction of mediation as an alternative dispute resolution method helps resolve minor issues faster without going through lengthy court procedures.\nPractical Steps to Protect Your Rights Being an aware consumer starts even before you make a purchase. Always remember to check product labels, compare prices, and read terms and conditions carefully. When buying expensive items, insist on proper bills and warranty cards. These documents serve as crucial evidence if you need to file a complaint later. If you do encounter a problem, first approach the seller or service provider directly. Many issues can be resolved at this stage through polite but firm communication. If this doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, you can escalate the matter by writing a formal complaint letter or email, keeping copies for your records.\nFor more serious disputes, you can approach consumer forums. India has a three-tier system of consumer courts - district, state, and national levels - that handle cases based on the value of the claim. The process is designed to be consumer-friendly, with provisions for filing complaints in simple language without needing a lawyer.\nWhy Student Consumers Need to Be Especially Aware As students, you might think consumer rights don\u0026rsquo;t apply to you yet, but that\u0026rsquo;s not true. Young consumers face unique challenges like being sold outdated stationery, defective electronic gadgets, or even being overcharged at local shops because of their age. Many students also make online purchases for books, games, or accessories, where the risk of fraud is higher. Moreover, understanding consumer rights prepares you for adult life when you\u0026rsquo;ll be making more significant purchases. The habits you develop now - like checking expiry dates, comparing prices, and keeping receipts will serve you well throughout your life.\nConclusion Consumer rights are not just legal concepts but practical tools that empower you in everyday life. The Consumer Protection Act, 2019 has strengthened these rights to match today\u0026rsquo;s digital shopping environment. As students and young consumers, you have the opportunity to develop good consumer habits early that will protect you throughout your life. The next time you make a purchase, whether it\u0026rsquo;s a chocolate bar or a mobile phone, remember that you\u0026rsquo;re protected by law. Don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to question unfair practices, demand proper bills, and stand up for your rights. After all, being an informed consumer is the first step toward becoming a responsible citizen.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/blog/understanding_uniform_civil_code/","title":"Understanding Uniform Civil Code","description":"In recent years, the debate over Uniform Civil Code (UCC) has gained fresh momentum in India.

While the Constitution of India envisions the UCC under Article 44, its implementation has remained a contentious issue, with strong arguments in both favour or against. But what exactly this Uniform Civil Code is and why is it becoming a hot topic of debate?\nWhat is Uniform Civil Code? All Indian people, regardless of their caste, religion, or tribe, are subject to the same set of rules known as the Uniform Civil Code, which regulates personal affairs including marriage, divorce, inheritance, adoption, and maintenance. The Hindu Marriage Act, the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat), the Christian Marriage Act, and other laws that are specific to a particular faith currently regulate these private affairs.\nThe idea behind the UCC is to replace these fragmented laws with one unified code that ensures equality, justice and national integration.\nConstitutional Basis of Uniform Civil Code Article 44 of Indian Constitution states: âThe State shall endeavour to secure for the citizens a Uniform Civil Code throughout the territory of India.â\nIt is a part of Directive Principle of State Policy not enforceable but meant to guide the governance of the country towards certain ideals.\nWhy is the UCC important? Promotes Equality: Every citizen is treated equally under a unified legislation. It eliminates gender-based discrimination against women in personal legislation, particularly in areas such as inheritance and divorce.\nStrengthens National Integration: By providing one set of civil laws for all, it fosters a sense of unity among diverse communities.\nUpholds Secularism: India is a secular state, and laws should not be influenced by religious doctrine.\nSimplifies Legal Doctrine: Multiple personal laws cause misunderstandings and inconsistencies. A UCC would guarantee consistency in rulings and expedite the judicial process.\nChallenges and Criticisms Cultural Sensitivity: India has a rich religious heritage and is a varied nation. Many people think that enforcing a single code could violate their religious and cultural identities.\nFear of Majoritarianism: Minority populations frequently worry that the UCC is a covert attempt to force their habits to match those of the majority.\nAbsence of Political Consensus: Because of its delicate nature, successive administrations have been reluctant to carry out this constitutional purpose.\nPractical Challenges: It is a challenging undertaking to draft a code that is equitable and acceptable to all religious and cultural groups.\nRecent Development On 27 January 2025, Uttarakhand became the first state of India to implement the UCC by passing Uttarakhand Uniform Civil Code Bill 2024.\nGoa was the first state that practiced a common civil code via The Portuguese Civil Code of 1867.\nAlso, Assam and Gujarat are the other two states who are working on the implementation of Uniform Civil Code.\nConclusion One of the most intricate and sensitive topics in Indian politics and culture is still the Uniform Civil Code. Its road is fraught with issues of identity, religion, and constitutional principles, despite its promises of equality and modernity. The secret is to take a progressive, comprehensive approach to law reform while striking a balance between individual rights and cultural liberties.\n***âà¤¸à¤®à¤¾à¤¨à¥ à¤§à¤°à¥à¤®à¤ à¤¸à¤°à¥à¤µà¥à¤·à¤¾à¤, à¤¸à¤®à¤¾à¤¨à¤ à¤ à¤¨à¥à¤¯à¤¾à¤¯à¤¦à¤°à¥à¤¶à¤¨à¤®à¥à¥¤*** à¤à¤à¤¤à¤¾ à¤¸à¤¦à¤¾ à¤°à¤¾à¤·à¥à¤à¥à¤°à¤¸à¥à¤¯, à¤¨à¥à¤µ à¤­à¥à¤¦à¤ à¤¸à¤à¤ªà¥à¤°à¤¦à¤¾à¤¯à¤¤à¤à¥¥â\n(Let the law be equal for all, Let justice have the same vision for all.\nUnity must always define the nation, Not division through faith or tradition.)\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/blog/pankajs_plea_from_khirbi/","title":"A Village Without Light: Pankajâs Plea from Khirbi","description":"A Village Without Light: Pankajâs Plea from Khirbi","date":"June 23, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/blog_cover/pankanj_blog_1_2025_hu_7f48412ff24ab250.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"630\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/blog_cover\\/pankanj_blog_1_2025_hu_9a1ec187a75617de.png';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/blog_cover/pankanj_blog_1_2025_hu_934888997b66d22d.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/blog_cover\\/pankanj_blog_1_2025_hu_ea0e92193381958a.png';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Cases, Legal, Human Rights, Legal Aid, Constitution, Public Policy","tags":"RightToLive, Nyaypurti, Khirbi, HumanRights, LegalAid, FundamentalRights, DDA, DelhiCantonment, ConstitutionalRights, VoicesOfTheIgnored","content":"A Village Without Light: Pankajâs Plea from Khirbi âWeâre not asking for luxuriesâjust light, water, and a right to live.â â Pankaj, resident of Khirbi\nA Forgotten Corner in the Heart of Delhi While Delhiâs skyline grows higher and brighter, there exists a neglected locality within its heartâKhirbi, a village under the Delhi Cantonment Board. This community has been denied basic human needs for over 30 to 40 years.\nNo electricity. No clean water. No civic development. Just human survivalâwithout dignity, without attention. The Voice of Khirbi â A Story from Pankaj When our team from Nyaypurti visited Khirbi, we met Pankaj, a young resident, educated and aware, yet helpless in the face of systemic silence.\nâEvery election season, ministers come with promisesâlight, water, houses. We vote for them. Then they disappear. Weâve been living in darkness for decades.â\nIn the peak of Delhiâs unbearable heat, Khirbiâs people have no fans, no drinking water, and no pipeline. Children are forced to study under candlelight. The elderly suffer from heat strokes. And diseases spread unchecked.\nNow, there are even threats of demolitionâwith no plan for relocation, despite some residents having DDA flat tokens or documents.\nWhat Happened to Article 21? Article 21 of the Constitution of India guarantees the Right to Life with dignity.\nIs a life without electricity, without water, and without hopeâ¦ still life?\nKhirbi raises urgent questions: Why have these people been denied basic civic infrastructure? Why are resettlement plans missing despite DDA involvement? Why demolish before offering alternative shelter? If three generations have lived here, how can they still be considered illegal?\nNyaypurtiâs Stand We at Nyaypurti did not go there with political motives. We went there with legal awareness, with resolve. âWe are not here to promise hope. We are here to show the path. The law is yours. Use it. Assert it.â\nOur goal is to: Empower residents with legal tools File RTIs and complaints Conduct awareness camps Explore public interest litigation Demand enforcement of their fundamental rights Our Appeal to the Authorities We appeal to: Delhi Cantonment Board Delhi Development Authority (DDA) Government of NCT of Delhi Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs If Khirbi has existed for 40 years, then its people exist as citizensânot as encroachers. You cannot erase decades of life overnight. You cannot talk about Smart Cities while parts of Delhi have no lights.\nThis Is Not Just About Khirbi This is not just Pankajâs story. This is the story of hundreds of invisible communitiesâneglected by policy, ignored by the system.\nLet us remember: Shelter is not a privilege. It is a necessity. Electricity is not a favour. It is a basic need. Water is not a demand. It is a human right. "}]
